        <h3 class="__light">Clicker training is an effective and fun training technique used to shape a desired behavior without the need to force, intimidate, or punish dogs while they learn. Small, easy to carry clickers are used to mark and identify a desired behavior from your pet, and the “click” is often followed by a treat or praise. With repetition, your dog will soon learn to associate the sound of the click with a reward, and get a sense that he or she has achieved something you want!</h3>
